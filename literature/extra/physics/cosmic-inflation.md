### About Big Bang: the Cosmic Inflation and its enemies

Here are some insides from the my favorite YouTube channels (**Closer To Truth** and **PBS Space Time**), patched with some ("anonymous" here) answers from physics.stackexchange.com .

Going back in time to the Big Bang (BB)? It is possible with general relativity ... to a certain point. There is no precise theory to describe it before some moment, when the Universe was very small, since there are conflicts between general relativity and quantum mechanics (see [PBS Space Time: "Big Bang problems: rewind Universe using general relativity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDmKLXVFJzk)).
The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy always increases, but in the final stage of the Big Bang it was already very high (gravitation apart ?), in an almost perfect thermal equilibrium. Why the urge to create matter, anything at all ? Gravitation! But why was it so quiet before?

Cosmic inflation, theory initiated by Alan Guth ([Closer To Truth: "Alan Guth - Why is an Inflationary Universe so Astounding?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv4Ikye9PS8)), explains some of the mysteries of the BB, like the flatness and the uniformity observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, it comes with issues: the entropy before inflation must have been even smaller than its already extraordinary low value (Penrose) and also, as a consequence, it implies a ... multiverse, a "fact" challenged by Abraham Loeb ([Closer To Truth: "Abraham 'Avi' Loeb - Multiverse - Where Do We Go From Here? (Part 2)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYSqCF5nKXc)).

#### About entropy
>"To allow galaxy and star formation, the universe had to start up in an extremely (but not perfectly) homogeneous state. The fact that the initial inhomogeneities were of size 1 part in a gadzillion (as opposed to zero) is what is puzzling."    
>"While the contents of the universe were in nearly perfect thermal equilibrium back then, there was another factor that brought them out of equilibrium: gravity. Being very evenly distributed is a low-entropy state as gravity is concerned. Entropy increases if matter is allowed to clump together, releasing potential energy and creating all sorts of inhomogenities that further disequilibrate the contents."     

To accommodate the second law of thermodynamics, the gravity had no effect during BB ? Roger Penrose ([Closer To Truth: "Sir Roger Penrose - What's Fundamental in the Cosmos?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLRrtUc-tPw)) challenges this: "in the BB, why wasn't gravity activated?", but he is somehow counter-current with his Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC). By the way, between these cyclic universes (eons), the entropy is simply ... reset (it is only a value, after all).

#### Some risks
 * The (im)probability of our Universe, by entropy, is ... 1 in 10 ^ 10 ^ 123, according to [Penrose](http://www.ws5.com/Penrose/). This is impossible with the current "approved" theories, therefore the need for Multiverse.
 * What if space (like entropy) is also ... a number that can be reset between eons (in CCC) ?
 * Maybe gravity is initially "hidden" by quantum mechanics !?

### Glossary
  * BB = Big Bang
  * CCC = Conformal cyclic cosmology, alternative theory to cosmic inflation, mainly by Penrose
  * CMB = Cosmic microwave background
