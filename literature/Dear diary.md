### 2019.02.26 [Hardest problem to problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4dx42YzQCE)
On my dearest **["The HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit"](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)** I struggled with a graph problem, with an easy solution in the end (as always): find the maximal edge cover so that no component contains more than one "forbidden" node. There is blood everywhere: [github link](

### 2019.01.18 Back to Haskell

   ... because one cannot have more SD <sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> fun than this (except for [Roxy Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOnde5c7OG8), but not SD <sup name="a1_1">[1](#f1)</sup>).
   
   So let's download GHC (or is it GCH?) for Windows ([here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html)):
   - made with the horrendous MSYS2  
   - 2GB of installation for a slowly building Death Star-sized machine
   - something, probably not important, about Glasgow
   
 But this is a tremendous occasion to start my survival professional diary. I am using this *md* cheat sheet <sup name="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> that I must keep somewhere, even if not very useful as `GitHub` has its own Markdown :(.    
  This must be the place, this must be my blog!
